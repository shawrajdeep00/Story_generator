# Story_generator

The Story Generator is a Python script designed to create customized stories based on user inputs. It utilizes a story template stored in a text file (`story.txt`) where certain placeholders are defined. Users are prompted to enter words that replace these placeholders, resulting in a unique story each time the script is run.

## How It Works

1. The script reads the story template from `story.txt` and identifies placeholders marked by angle brackets (e.g., `<place1>`, `<adjective1>`).
2. Users are prompted to input words for each placeholder based on the story context.
3. The script replaces the placeholders with the user-provided words, generating the final Madlibs story.
4. The completed story is then displayed to the user.

## Learning Opportunities

By exploring this code, developers can learn:

- File handling in Python for reading and manipulating text files.
- String manipulation techniques to identify and replace placeholders in a text.
- Input handling and user interaction through command-line prompts.
- The concept of dynamic content generation based on templates, useful in text processing applications.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the script

## Story Template

The `story.txt` file contains a template for the story. Placeholders in the format <placeholder> are replaced with user-provided words.
For explanation purpose, this sample story has been generated using GPT 3.5 model, on which the work has been done.
You can find the sample file in the repository.
